1.0.4 (2020-03-04)
------------------
* Fix for possible crash with None in pose
* Element parsing extended to stop tf publishing if nan or inf is in the pose
* Using vector distance to update element pose less often. (using same thresholds as in rosmogen).

1.0.2 (2019-08-26)
------------------
* Merge branch 'master' into develop
* Merge remote-tracking branch 'scalable/master'
* Spatial reasoner keeps trying to convert a pose to right parent frame. Timestamps info is removed after a successful transformation.
* Minor fix and reduction for execution rate to 25Hz
* Minor fix and reduction for execution rate to 25Hz
* Modified warn output when missing tf.
* Not publishing tf when transform fails
* Restored precondition check in wm move object and spatial reasoner doesn't add relation to scene if PublishTf is false
* Merge pull request `#1 <https://github.com/RVMI/skiros2_std_lib/issues/1>`_ from ScalABLE40/catkin_lint
  Catkin lint
* linted skiros2_std_reasoners
* Handling of poses and transforms with a given timestamp
* Bug-fix when removing property LinkedToFrameId and PushToFrameId
* Spatial reasoner can push a frame id on tf when property PushToFrameId is set. Used to update the camera pose dynamically.
* Minor change
* Minor fix
